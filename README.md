Small (under 2.5 x 2.5 cm) motor control board, designed for the TB6552 dual H-bridge chip.

The motor can be controlled through the 595 shift register, allowing multiple boards to be chained together.

Individual motors can also have their PWM frequency controlled directly from external pins, instead of through the shift register, allowing for faster PWM and using PWM output pins of a microcontroller.
